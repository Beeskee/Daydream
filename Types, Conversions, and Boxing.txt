Automation objects can contain: integers, floating point numbers, strings, arrays, other Automation objects, and some things that have no equivalent in AutoHotkey.  That's it.  AutoHotkey apparently converts arrays to its internal format directly so I guess we can use that.

AutoHotkey makes you tell it what the return type of a DLL call will be (which is always scalar), so you can know what to treat it as based on that.
