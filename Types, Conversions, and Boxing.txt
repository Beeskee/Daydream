Automation objects can contain: integers, floating point numbers, strings, arrays, other Automation objects, and some things that have no equivalent in AutoHotkey.  That's it.  AutoHotkey apparently converts arrays to its internal format directly so I guess we can use that.

AutoHotkey makes you tell it what the return type of a DLL call will be (which is always scalar), so you can know what to treat it as based on that.

You will probably have to use type specifiers for functions you intend to expose to AutoHotkey, since it is otherwise ambiguous what a AutoHotkey value should be boxed as.  We might as well also use this for detecting defects within our programming language.

Unboxing is not ambiguous, and therefore can be done automatically.
